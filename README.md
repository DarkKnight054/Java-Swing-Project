  Itâ€™s a brainstorming game which is modified from a chess game. In this game, you have to place chess-pieces
  as described in the upper right corner such that they won't attack each other in their first move. If your 
  move is invalid the box will be red and you lost that round. If you pass the round the box will be green. 
  You have a time limit to complete this game. And a ghost will run behind you. In case If you can't complete 
  your move at a finite time limit the ghost will arrive and he will eat all your chess-pieces. Also, when 
  the ghost arrives your life will reduce. you will be given some coins in random boxes. you have to place 
  chess-pieces in those boxes to earn coins. You can't unlock a level if you don't complete the previous levels.
  But you can unlock a level by a certain amount of coins.
