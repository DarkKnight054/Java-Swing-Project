move is invalid the box will be red and you lost that round. If you pass the round the box will be green. 
You have a time limit to complete this game. And a ghost will run behind you. In case If you can't complete 
your move at a finite time limit the ghost will arrive and he will eat all your chess-pieces. Also, when 
the ghost arrives your life will reduce.
